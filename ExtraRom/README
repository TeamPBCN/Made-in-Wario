Since there is a file path list in the patch RomFS(patch:/Data/FilePathListPatch.dat) for 
controling which files are enable for using in the patch to replace the same one in the orign RomFS, 
it is impossible to do the place-&-play file replacement stuff. This means you CANNOT just 
archiving files into the patch RomFS for the game program to automatically override the 
orign RomFS files like many other games.

Of course, we can do some researches on this file list format(FilePathListPatch.dat), and re-generate a new 
one which contains the file list which we want to put in the patch follow the same format. But 
this is only work for this one game. Because different developer may uses different solutions. 
So this solution is just wasting time, in my opinion.

We can also use LayeredFS function which is embeded into Luma3DS now. But the fact is, not every 
users are using Luma. And dispatching a lot of files as a localization patch is not convenience.

Is there a more universual way to do this job? Fortunately, the answer is YES. Since the vast majority 
of developers are using ctr_sdk libraries to develop their games, the I/O functions are same 
in these games. So we can just do some hooks on the library functions to achieve our goal.
